# Hello, World! This is a website for Wahoo BBQ!

Their current website is a simple Wix site, and looked a little a bit outdated.
So, I thought it would be a perfect time to practice my web design, so I did a revamp of their old site.

### This project was built with Next.js, and is currently hosted on vercel.

Wahoo BBQ already has all of their online ordering and whatnot in place (through a third-party), so this was just a front-end revamp.
I think most of their web traffic is coming from mobile so I definitely spent more time making sure it looked the best for mobile users.

I was going for a modern look while still incorporating their key values and mission. I wanted the user to still feel like they would get the authentic VA barbecue experience, so I didn't want to get overly flashy.
